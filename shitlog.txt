Instructions said before I can push an app to heroku I have to initialize a local git repo and commit my files to it.

So, I have to cd to where my app is. Locally it is in that newly cloned directory. So I cd to that directory.

cd myapp
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "my first commit"
